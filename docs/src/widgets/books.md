# Book widget 

It is a part of an exploratory mode and a kick starter. It helps the user to start with something, two types of users are there to access the book widget, one with the goal and another without a goal, and goal setting is an important part of life. So if the user comes without any goal this widget can help the user to start and set their goals. Users can begin their journey by interacting with different content, searching for new things, etc. Books contain lots of knowledge, increase awareness which can help you to set your goals.

This widget fetches two types of books.
- Books from different sources/platforms which fetches direct.
- Books from our platform TJ which supports markdown format.
