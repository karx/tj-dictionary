## Book List

The BookList widget lists a collection of books, each converted in markdown format for efficient machine-readability.


### Interface

![Interface-of-book-list-widget](https://gitlab.com/edvanta/gomad/thoughtjumper/tj-dictionary/-/wikis/uploads/25f26797624d324fbd541d214880932f/Interface-of-book-list-widget.png)


### Adding books

To add books:
  - Convert the file into a markdown format. PDF files can be converted to markdown using [this tool](https://pdf2md.morethan.io/)
  - Upload the file in [this Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15w1Q72DiUj7pskqKD0FYMElMhKUNx_Nn)
  - share the book's cover image in PNG format with TJ Development Team (this is important because book's cover image is uploaded in a different assets folder at AWS)


### How to use this widget
