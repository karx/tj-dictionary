## Gutenberg Library Widget

### About this Widget

- By default, this widget is listed as a tab right next to the Library widget in the middlemost top panel.
- Books here are sourced using the Gutenberg API. Project Gutenberg is a library for free eBooks.
- These books open in an iframe component, so other than the title, the book content doesn't manipulate other widgets.

### How to use this Widget

- Switch to the Gutenberg Library tab
- Navigate to the book you want to read.

### Future

- Combine with the Library widget
- Filter books (by genre, date added, author, etc)
- Search box(to search within the book)
- Recommended books
- Allowing users to add books to their private vault
