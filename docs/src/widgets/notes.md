## Notes widget

The NotedItems widget shows the saved and drafted thoughts in a list format. It has a markdown-powered text editor for writing thoughts using basic HTML tags. To save useful information from external web pages like - text, image, and video, boost-ed extension will need to be installed.

### Creating Notes

Here are the two ways for creating notes:

#### From Text Area

The text area, available for creating notes, is powered with marked.js, allowing usage of HTML tags. Here is the documentation on marked.js to understand all the HTML tags that can be used.

- Click on the add note icon to reveal the text area (click on the same icon to collapse the text area)
- Type in your note in the text area
- Click on the 'Add Note' button to publish your note

- Users will be able to delete their notes only
- Users will be able to edit their notes after publishing them
- Add a WYSIWYG-like editor option
- Users will be able to download their notes
- Images will be added as notes when dragged and dropped
- Users will be able to reference their notes
